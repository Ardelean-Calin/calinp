## Introduction

Welcome to my personal DevBlog/Portofolio!
<!--more-->
The purpose of this site is to document the various projects I am working on. It's mostly a personal thing, so I don't really care if no-one sees this webpage ever, but I do want to use it as a CV of sorts, as well.

**Stay tuned!**
